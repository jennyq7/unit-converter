# Unit Converter

The unit converter is a tool I developed for anyone to use who would like to convert ounce measurement into millimeters. For example some juice stores have their sizes listed in ounces. With this tool you can easily convert to millimeters for any customers who only understand the metric system. 

## Tech Stack

I used HTML, CSS, SASS, JavaScript, Typescript and React.js to build this app.

## Installations:

I installed React and Typescript at the same time.
I then installed react-router-dom and SASS

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
